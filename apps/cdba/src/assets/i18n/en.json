The protection of your privacy when using our online offer is very important for us. If personal data is processed, we observe the applicable data protection laws.</p> <h5>I. General information about data processing</h5></br><h5>1. Scope and purpose of processing of personal data</h5> <p>In principle, we collect and use your personal data only insofar as it is necessary to provide a functional website as well as our content and services offered on the website. The processing of your personal data takes place either on the basis of your consent or insofar as the legal regulations allow this data processing even without consent.</p> <h5>2. Legal basis for data processing</h5> <p>Your personal data is processed on the basis of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the applicable local data protection law, f.e. the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG).</br></br> Insofar as you have given us consent to process personal data for specific purposes, Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data. Consent given can be revoked by you at any time. Please note that the revocation is only effective for the future. Processing that took place before the revocation is not affected.</br></br> Processing of personal data in the context of the performance of a contract to which you are a party or in order to take steps prior to entering a contract at your request is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR. The purposes of data processing are governed by the respective contract documents and the subject matter of the contract.</br></br> If processing of personal data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject, Art. 6 (1) lit. c GDPR serves as a legal basis.</br></br> If processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Schaeffler or by a third party (e.g., to assert legal claims and defend against legal disputes; to ensure IT security; to prevent criminal acts; for business management measures and for the further development of services and products) and if your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms as data subject do not override the aforementioned interest, Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing.</p> <h5>3. Data erasure and retention period</h5> <p>We process and store your personal data for as long as this is necessary to satisfy the respective purpose. In addition, such storage may take place in order to comply with a legal obligation by Union or Member State law, regulation or other provision to which we as controller are subject. If the data is no longer necessary or if a retention period prescribed by the aforementioned laws has expired, your tracking-data will be erased regularly after 90 days. The user settings data can be deleted on request.</p> <h5>4. Access to personal data within the Schaeffler Group and by third parties</h5> <p>Within the Schaeffler Group, those entities gain access to your data who require it as a part of “least privilege” (assignment of user rights to the lowest possible extent) and the “need-to-know” principle (knowledge of data only if necessary).</br></br> We may only transfer data to third parties outside the Schaeffler Group if this is necessary, if statutory provision so requires, you have consented or processors engaged by us have contractually agreed to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and applicable local data protection law.</br></br> Under these circumstances, recipients of personal data may include: Microsoft Azure</p> <h5>5. Transfer of personal data to a third country or to an international organisation</h5> <p>A transfer of data to countries outside the EU/EEA (so-called third countries) will only take place as it is necessary or required by law, you have given your consent or as part of data processing by a processor. If service providers in third countries are deployed, in addition to written instructions, they are required to comply with data protection standards in Europe by agreeing on the EU standard contractual clauses.</p> <h5>6. IT security and links to third-party websites</h5> <p>The Schaeffler Group uses technical and organizational security measures to protect your data that we manage against accidental or intentional destruction, manipulation, loss or access by unauthorized persons. These safeguards are constantly being developed in accordance with the respective new technical possibilities.</br></br> Our websites may contain links to websites of other providers. Our information on data protection does not apply to these websites.</p> <h5>7. Obligation to provide personal data</h5> <p>If we provide you with offers and services on this website that you can voluntarily use, there is no duty to provide your data to us, but without your personal data, you may not be able to use our offers and services. </p> <h5>8. „Profiling“ and automated decision-making</h5> <p>We do not use fully automated decision-making pursuant to Art. 22 GDPR. Schaeffler basically does not use “profiling”. If we use it in individual cases, we will inform you about this separately, if it is required by law and – if necessary - obtain your prior consent.</p> <h5>9. Sources of your personal data</h5> <p>We use data that we receive from you..</p> <h5>II. Data processing for the provision of the website and the creation of log files</h5> <p>By default, when you visit our website, our web servers obtain and collect the name of your Internet service provider, your IP address, the website from which you are visiting us, the websites you visit on our website, and the date and duration of the visit. This data is stored in the log files of our systems and is used for problem or error analysis. However, the use of the IP address is limited to the technically necessary extent and is abbreviated and therefore used only anonymously, so that it is not possible to assign the IP address to a user. The data is not merged with personal data.</br></br> The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</br></br> The temporary storage of the abbreviated IP address by our systems is technically necessary to display the website to your terminal device. Storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the website. Data is not being analyzed for marketing purposes in this context.</br></br> For these purposes, we have legitimate interest in processing of data according to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.</br></br> The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of data in log files is essential for the operation of the website. Therefore, there is no possibility for you as a user to object to such processing.</p> <h5>III. Data processing in respect of services offered on the website</h5> <p>On our website various services are offered, for the use of which we request personal data from you.

In addition to the repair work required, this incurs additional costs due to machine downtime and lost production.",
        "It is significantly more cost-effective to provide for the use an electrically insulating product at the planning stage. As a result, customer benefit is increased through reduced maintenance costs and higher machine availability. Normally, it is sufficient to interrupt the circuit between the housing and shaft in order, depending on the application, to insert a current insulating solution at one or both bearing positions.",

        "In general, it is difficult to eliminate the causes of electrical voltage in the rolling bearing. Nevertheless, bearing damage can be prevented if it is possible to stop or significantly reduce the flow of current. Essentially, three relevant types of current flow must be considered: capacitive currents, high-frequency circular currents and rotor-earth currents. Especially with inverter-powered motors, so-called parasitic effects can occur, which lead to damage on the rolling bearing.",

For the effective values of current and voltage under a harmonic time curve with a pulsatance Ꞷ, the formula is: I = U · Ꞷ· C. The goal is to build a capacitance with a low value, so that less charges can be applied. For the 700 µm thick J20GG coating we reach values of nearly 1.1 nF. (Measured on Bearing type 6315). Its capacitive resistance at a frequency of 50 Hz is thus in the range of 3 MΩ, for a frequency of 1000 Hz instead only 0.15 MΩ. In other words, significantly lower than its direct current voltage resistance. Nevertheless, it will in most cases be significantly higher than the resistance of the non-insulated bearing, which is only very low (1 Ω or less) at voltages above 1 V. ",

Quantitative kowledge about supplier-specific greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions is key for calculating product-specific footprints for our customers as well as Schaeffler's company-wide emissions - both topics of upmost importance today and tomorrow.",
        "<b>1. Initial situation</b>",
        "Schaeffler purchases over one million tons of steel per year. At the same time, over 300 different steel grades differing in chemical composition, metallurgical and/or mechanical properties are available for use in Schaeffler products. However, not every steel grade can be pruchased from every of our over 200 released suppliers. Only after a tight technical assessment by our steel supplier development department, a supplier is allowed to deliver a certain steel grade. This release might then be limited to certain production routes, steel plants, and product dimensions. Certain applications, such as for use in wind-power plants, additionally demand material purchase from suppliers with a long-term record of delivering high-quality material (see <a class=\"text-link hover:underline hover:cursor-pointer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sapdms.schaeffler.com:8080/jsf/dd.faces?sap=EP1&dokar=ASI&doknr=S266042&doktl=EN\">S 266042</a> for more information). Up to now, all these information have been collected in various Excel lists, making it comparably time-consuming and potentially error-prone to \"select the right supplier for the right material for the right application\".",
        "Besides the importance of supplier-specific information for the purchasing process, data on the suppliers' CO2e (or more generally greenhouse-gas, GHG) emissions is attracting more and more interest - both from our customers and from the general public. In this context, it is important to note that GHG emissions created during raw-material production typically contribute more than 70% to the product carbon footprints (PCF) of Schaeffler’s products. The precise knowledge of these so-called Scope 3.1 upstream emissions (for purchased goods and services) is therefore important both for assessing product-specific GHG footprints (via lifecycle assessment) and for reducing our overall emissions to reach our aim of climate neutrality by 2040. Typically, the values for GHG emissions range from a few hundred kg to several tons per ton of purchased material and depend on many details during the (raw) material production process. It is therefore generally not appropriate to use literature data or other averaged values for calculating GHG emissions as this data neglects the immense influence of supplier-specific production routes on the emitted GHGs.",

        "We integrated all above mentioned information of approved steel suppliers (maximum dimensions, release restrictions, supplier rating, supplier-specific GHG emission factors etc.) in one central database - the “Materials Supplier Database” (MSD). As of September 2022, the GHG emission factors of our most important steel suppliers can be found in the database; integration of other (raw) material classes, including aluminum, copper, ceramics, hard magnets, lubricants, polymers will take place later this year of early 2023. The Materials Supplier Database is integrated in the Materials App Center and available via web browser for daily work and purchasing decisions and as application programmable interface (API) for integration in PCF (product carbon footprint) calculation tools such as TcPCM or GaBi. Next, various extensions are planned, e.g. inclusion of non-steel materials, information about (the ISO 14067 conformity of) the calculation method used to derive the GHG emissions of the presented data, inclusion of historic evolution and/or future expectations of supplier-specific footprints.",

        "With the MSD we offer a reliable, available, integrable, and single source of truth for raw-material GHG emission factors. The availability of this data is key to reach our aim of climate neutrality by 2040 (because it is needed to steer purchasing decisions as well as design and material-selection considerations) and for maintaining or even improving our market position (by offering transparent, high-quality information about the PCFs of our products to our customers).",

        "Hardness measurements are a very important means to ensure the reliability of Schaeffler products. Most products have a certain method for the hardness measurement given on the drawing or in product specific standards. However, sometimes it is necessary to convert hardnesses from one measurement method to another, e.g. if the measurement method is not appropriate for the size or the material condition of the sample (see S266010 for details), or to estimate the ultimate tensile strength from hardness values. This is usually done using the conversion charts of ISO 18265, if not integrated in the measuring device.",
        "The Hardness Converter in Materials App Center (MAC HC) allows the conversion of measured hardnesses according to different hardness conversion tables from different standards. The following tables are implemented:",
        "<ul><li>ISO 18265, Table A.1 — Conversion of hardness-to-hardness or hardness-to-tensile-strength values for unalloyed and low alloy steels and cast steel</li><li>ISO 18265, Table B.2 — Conversion of hardness-to-hardness and hardness-to-tensile-strength values for quenching and tempering steels in the quenched tempered conditions</li><li>ISO 18265, Table B.3 — Conversion of hardness-to-hardness or hardness-to-tensile-strength values for quenching and tempering steels in the untreated, soft annealed or normalized conditions</li><li>ISO 18265, Table B.4 — Conversion of hardness-to-hardness values for quenching and tempering steels in the quenched condition</li><li>ISO 18265, Table C.2 — Conversion of hardness-to-hardness values for cold working steels</li><li>ISO 18265, Table F.1 — Nickel and High-Nickel Alloys</li><li>ISO 18265, Table F.2 — Cartridge brass (70 % Copper, 30 % Zinc Alloy)</li><li>ISO 18265, Table F.4 — Wrought Aluminium Products</li><li>ISO 18265, Table F.5 — Aluminium and its Alloys</li><li>ASTM E140, Table 1 Approximate Hardness Conversion Numbers for Non-Austenitic Steels (Rockwell C Hardness Range)</li><li>ASTM E140, Table 3 Approximate Hardness Conversion Numbers for Nickel and High-Nickel Alloys</li><li>ASTM E140, Table 4 Approximate Hardness Conversion Numbers for Cartridge Brass (70 % Copper 30 % Zinc Alloy)</li><li>ASTM E140, Table 9 Approximate Hardness Conversion Numbers for Wrought Aluminum Products</li><li>Schaeffler, Internal conversion rule for oil tempered spring steel.</li><ul>",
        "The standard conversion chart is set to ISO 18265 Table A.1 for low and unalloyed steels. Depending on the availability of the respective hardness methods in the respective tables, a conversion from and to Vickers (HV), Brinell (HB), Rockwell A (HRA), Rockwell B (HRB), and Rockwell C (HRC) and the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) in MPa is performed.",
        "When perfoming a hardness conversion, the right conversion table must be chosen.  The most universal conversion table for steel is ISO 18265 table A.1, which is the default value. However, when having a different material (e. g. aluminium, brass, a highly alloyed steel) or a heat-treated or cold-worked material, make sure to select the right conversion table. When performing a conversion for thermo or thermo-chemically treated steels, for carbonitrided, nitrided or nitrocarburised parts, multi-phase or self-hardening steels, cast iron or alloyed non-iron metals, great care must be used in chosing the right table and interpreting the results. The standard conversion tables are usually not suited for these special cases.",
        "The user interface has some features. You should select the right conversion table from the dropdown box, in case the default value \"ISO 18265 table A.1\" is not the right one for your problem. Clicking the Reset button at the bottom, resets the full user interface to its initial state. The Share button on the upper right corner, allows to send the link to the hardness converter to other users, without preserving already entered or converted hardness values.",
        "In case, the conversion cannot be performed, because the value is not in the range of the selected conversion table, the value will be presented as \"out-of-range\", as a valid conversion result cannot be given. In case the chosen conversion table does not contain any data for converting your specific hardness values, because the hardness method is not not given, a \"not-in-table\" warning will be shown.",
        "It is possible to enter multiple hardness values. In that case the arithmetic mean and the standard deviation is calculated. The conversion then is done using the arithmetic mean value for all measurement methods in the MAC hardness converter.",
        "The resulting conversion value can be copied to the clipboard by clicking on the clipboard symbol to the right of the values and can then be pasted in any Office document, email, or wherever you like.",
        "In case multiple values are given, the hardness converter checks the values for plausibility. Therefore it considers the measurements as a series of measurements on one and the same part and performs a repeat precision check according S285018, as you would do with calibration plates. In case the multiple hardness values do not comply with the repeatability test, a short warning message appears. The warning is just a reminder for the user to check if the measurements are plausible, i. e. a measurement might result in a warning, but due to locally changing microstructure (e. g. Pearlite formation) the measurement might still be correct. As the repeat precision is dependent on some other factors too, and in order to keep the hardness converter simple, only some repeat precision values were chosen. In case some special rules apply (e. g. micro hardness testing), think about results and possible different repeat precision ranges.",

        "The repeat precision for Brinell is at that load level at 3 %, resulting in ≈ 6 HB allowance. When entering the values above, a warning message appears, as the maximum value of 207 HB is out of the range: the difference between maximum and minimum value is larger than the allowance (207 HB - 200 HB = 7 HB > 6 HB). This reminds you to maybe think about the value of 207 HB.",
        "The arithmetic mean value of 203 HB is then converted in the other values, e.g. to 214 HV, 686 MPa, etc.. However, for HRC and HRA the conversion is only possible for ≥228 HB according ISO 18265, table A.1, so the respective values are given as “out-of-range”.",

        "When hardening steels, one must know, if a material can be fully hardened, i. e. the hardness on the surface as well as in the core of the material is the same. On many drawings the QM value (German for materialbezogener Querschnittswert, material-related cross-section value) can be found. In order to choose the right material for the part, a material must be chosen, where AQM > QM. The analytical QM value is a theoretical, calculated value, that gives something like the critical diameter of a part, but is actually not a measurable diameter. To calculate the AQM value, the chemical composition of a steel, i. e. the element contents of Carbon, Silicon, Manganese, Chromium, Molybdenum, and Nickel in weight percent, are consecutively entered in eight polynomial equations given in <a class=\"text-link hover:underline hover:cursor-pointer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sapdms.schaeffler.com:8080/jsf/dd.faces?sap=EP1&dokar=ASI&doknr=S130998&doktl=EN\">S 130998</a>. The final result is the AQM value, that can be compared to the QM values given on the drawings.",
        "Using the AQM Calculator you have different ways to enter your data. You can either select one of the predefined steel compositions from the drop-down list or enter the specific values in the six given input boxes. If you change the values in the input boxes, the drop-down list will contain “Custom alloy”. The values must be given in mass percent, as usual with steel compositions.",
        "The AQM value is then calculated together with the sum value of the contents of Cr, Mn and Si. This sum value is an indicator, how high the content of chemical elements are, that contribute when hardening the material. The technical delivery conditions for the respective materials have limit values for the sum value. Depending on the material, in the section Limits, below right, you can see if the limit for a certain material is reached or not. In the image you can see that the limit for 100Cr6 is reached, but not for the other materials.",
        "../../../assets/img/learnmore/aqm/aqm_1.png",
        "The calculation of the AQM value is primarily restricted to through-hardening steels (100Cr6, 100CrMnSi6-4, 100CrMo7-3, 100CrMnMoSi8-4-6, etc.), but also some other steel alloys (e. g. C80) might be correctly calculated as long as the element contents are in a certain range:",
        "C: 0.6 - 1.1<br>Si: 0.0 - 1.5<br>Mn: 0.0 - 1.5<br>Cr: 0.0 -2.0<br>Mo: 0.0 - 1.0<br>Ni: 0.0 -1.6",
        "Outside these ranges, the predictions are no longer valid and the tool will display a warning and not calculate or update the result.",
        "<b>Example</b>",
        "You have a material 100CrMnSi6-4 and the respective element content values, e. g. from a material certificate or a measurement. You enter the data in the input boxes (see image below). The chemical values are within the allowed limits of a 100CrMnSi6-4. The AQM value is calculated to be 62.7 and the sum value is 3.1. The sum value reaches the limits for 100Cr6, 100CrMo7 and 100CrMo7-3, indicated by a green check mark, but not for 100CrMnMoSi8-4-6 and 100CrMnSi6-4, indicated by a red exclamation mark. But as this material is 100CrMnSi6-4 the sum value is not reached for that material. The material might still be used for smaller parts, but one must think about it.",

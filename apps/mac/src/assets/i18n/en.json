        "The Materials Supplier Database provides access to important data on Schaeffler's raw-material suppliers. The data included in the database ranges from purchasing-relevant information about the supplier rating after <a class=\"text-link hover:underline hover:cursor-pointer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sapdms.schaeffler.com:8080/jsf/dd.faces?sap=EP1&dokar=ASI&doknr=S266042&doktl=EN\">S 266042</a>, maximum released dimensions for steel products to supplier-specific CO2e emission factors. Quantitative kowledge about supplier-specific greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions is key for calculating product-specific footprints for our customers as well as Schaeffler's company-wide emissions - both topics of upmost importance today and tomorrow.",
        "<b>1. Initial situation</b>",
        "Schaeffler purchases over one million tons of steel per year. At the same time, over 300 different steel grades differing in chemical composition, metallurgical and/or mechanical properties are available for use in Schaeffler products. However, not every steel grade can be pruchased from every of our over 200 released suppliers. Only after a tight technical assessment by our steel supplier development department, a supplier is allowed to deliver a certain steel grade. This release might then be limited to certain production routes, steel plants, and product dimensions. Certain applications, such as for use in wind-power plants, additionally demand material purchase from suppliers with a long-term record of delivering high-quality material (see <a class=\"text-link hover:underline hover:cursor-pointer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sapdms.schaeffler.com:8080/jsf/dd.faces?sap=EP1&dokar=ASI&doknr=S266042&doktl=EN\">S 266042</a> for more information). Up to now, all these information have been collected in various Excel lists, making it comparably time-consuming and potentially error-prone to \"select the right supplier for the right material for the right application\".",
        "Besides the importance of supplier-specific information for the purchasing process, data on the suppliers' CO2e (or more generally greenhouse-gas, GHG) emissions is attracting more and more interest - both from our customers and from the general public. In this context, it is important to note that GHG emissions created during raw-material production typically contribute more than 70% to the product carbon footprints (PCF) of Schaeffler’s products. The precise knowledge of these so-called Scope 3.1 upstream emissions (for purchased goods and services) is therefore important both for assessing product-specific GHG footprints (via lifecycle assessment) and for reducing our overall emissions to reach our aim of climate neutrality by 2040. Typically, the values for GHG emissions range from a few hundred kg to several tons per ton of purchased material and depend on many details during the (raw) material production process. It is therefore generally not appropriate to use literature data or other averaged values for calculating GHG emissions as this data neglects the immense influence of supplier-specific production routes on the emitted GHGs.",
        "../../../assets/img/learnmore/msd/msd_1.png",
        "<i>Company-wide GHG emissions by category (left) [Sustain] and overview of supplier-specific GHG emission factors (right)</i>",
        "<b>2. Solution</b>",
        "We integrated all above mentioned information of approved steel suppliers (maximum dimensions, release restrictions, supplier rating, supplier-specific GHG emission factors etc.) in one central database - the “Materials Supplier Database” (MSD). As of September 2022, the GHG emission factors of our most important steel suppliers can be found in the database; integration of other (raw) material classes, including aluminum, copper, ceramics, hard magnets, lubricants, polymers will take place later this year of early 2023. The Materials Supplier Database is integrated in the Materials App Center and available via web browser for daily work and purchasing decisions and as application programmable interface (API) for integration in PCF (product carbon footprint) calculation tools such as TcPCM or GaBi. Next, various extensions are planned, e.g. inclusion of non-steel materials, information about (the ISO 14067 conformity of) the calculation method used to derive the GHG emissions of the presented data, inclusion of historic evolution and/or future expectations of supplier-specific footprints.",
        "../../../assets/img/learnmore/msd/msd_2.png",
        "<i>Several data sources containing information about approved steel suppliers are centralized in the Materials Supplier Database.</i>",
        "<b>3. Conclusion</b>",
        "With the MSD we offer a reliable, available, integrable, and single source of truth for raw-material GHG emission factors. The availability of this data is key to reach our aim of climate neutrality by 2040 (because it is needed to steer purchasing decisions as well as design and material-selection considerations) and for maintaining or even improving our market position (by offering transparent, high-quality information about the PCFs of our products to our customers).",

      "content": [
        "Hardness measurements are a very important means to ensure the reliability of Schaeffler products. Most products have a certain method for the hardness measurement given on the drawing or in product specific standards. However, sometimes it is necessary to convert hardnesses from one measurement method to another, e.g. if the measurement method is not appropriate for the size or the material condition of the sample (see S266010 for details), or to estimate the ultimate tensile strength from hardness values. This is usually done using the conversion charts of ISO 18265, if not integrated in the measuring device.",
        "The Hardness Converter in Materials App Center (MAC HC) allows the conversion of measured hardnesses according ISO 18265 Table A.1 from and to Vickers (HV), Brinell (HB), Rockwell A (HRA), Rockwell B (HRB), and Rockwell C (HRC) and the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) in MPa.",
        "The conversion according ISO 18265 table A.1 is usually used for unalloyed and low alloyed steels, in soft and hardened states. The application to high alloyed and austenitic steels as well as thermo or thermo-chemically treated steels (induction or case hardening) can also work sufficiently. However, using the conversion for carbonitrided and nitrided or nitrocarburised parts might reasonably be possible, but must be used with greater care. Using the conversion for materials like multi-phase or self-hardening steels, cast iron or non-iron metals is not recommended.",
        "The user interface has some features. Clicking the Reset button at the bottom, resets the full user interface to its initial state. The Share button on the upper right corner, allows to send the link to the hardness converter to other users, without preserving already entered or converted hardness values.",
        "In case, the conversion cannot be performed, because the value is not in the range of table A.1, the value will be presented as “out-of-range”, as a valid conversion result cannot be given.",
        "It is possible to enter multiple hardness values. In that case the arithmetic mean and the standard deviation is calculated. The conversion then is done using the arithmetic mean value for all measurement methods in the MAC hardness converter.",
        "The resulting conversion value can be copied to the clipboard by clicking on the clipboard symbol to the right of the values and can then be pasted in any Office document, email, or wherever you like.",
        "In case multiple values are given, the hardness converter checks the values for plausibility. Therefore it considers the measurements as a series of measurements on one and the same part and performs a repeat precision check according S285018, as you would do with calibration plates. In case the multiple hardness values do not comply with the repeatability test, a short warning message appears. The warning is just a reminder for the user to check if the measurements are plausible, i. e. a measurement might result in a warning, but due to locally changing microstructure (e. g. Pearlite formation) the measurement might still be correct. As the repeat precision is dependent on some other factors too, and in order to keep the hardness converter simple, only some repeat precision values were chosen. In case some special rules apply (e. g. micro hardness testing), think about results and possible different repeat precision ranges.",
        "The following repeat precisions were implemented (H̅: average hardness value):",
        "../../../assets/img/learnmore/hc_table.png",
        "Example",
        "You want to convert three hardness values (200 HB, 201 HB, 207 HB) from Brinell to Vickers.",
        "The repeat precision for Brinell is at that load level at 3 %, resulting in ≈ 6 HB allowance. When entering the values above, a warning message appears, as the maximum value of 207 HB is out of the range: the difference between maximum and minimum value is larger than the allowance (207 HB - 200 HB = 7 HB > 6 HB). This reminds you to maybe think about the value of 207 HB.",
        "The arithmetic mean value of 203 HB is then converted in the other values, e.g. to 214 HV, 686 MPa, etc.. However, for HRC and HRA the conversion is only possible for ≥228 HB according ISO 18265, table A.1, so the respective values are given as “out-of-range”.",
        "../../../assets/img/learnmore/hc_example.png",
        "The hardness converter is free to use and free of charge. Just a Schaeffler user account is necessary."

        "Current passage can occur in the use of rolling bearings in industrial and automotive applications. Under unfavorable conditions, this causes damage to raceways and rolling elements as well as degradation of the lubricant and thus to premature, unexpected failure of a motor or generator. In addition to the repair work required, this incurs additional costs due to machine downtime and lost production.",
        "It is significantly more cost-effective to provide for the use an electrically insulating product at the planning stage. As a result, customer benefit is increased through reduced maintenance costs and higher machine availability. Normally, it is sufficient to interrupt the circuit between the housing and shaft in order, depending on the application, to insert a current insulating solution at one or both bearing positions.",
        "<b>1 Initial situation</b>",
        "In general, it is difficult to eliminate the causes of electrical voltage in the rolling bearing. Nevertheless, bearing damage can be prevented if it is possible to stop or significantly reduce the flow of current. Essentially, three relevant types of current flow must be considered: capacitive currents, high-frequency circular currents and rotor-earth currents. Especially with inverter-powered motors, so-called parasitic effects can occur, which lead to damage on the rolling bearing.",

For voltages up to 1000 V this leads to a current of 1 µA through the bearing, which is absolutely uncritical. Even with the existing coating types we reach for voltages up to 1000V a current of only 20 µA.

        "The insulated unit represents a capacitance C, which can accumulate charges. Under the influence of an alternating current voltage, this leads to an alternating current due to direct contact between the rolling element and raceway. For the effective values of current and voltage under a harmonic time curve with a pulsatance Ꞷ, the formula is: I = U · Ꞷ· C. The goal is to build a capacitance with a low value, so that less charges can be applied. For the 700 µm thick J20GG coating we reach values of nearly 1.1 nF. (Measured on Bearing type 6315). Its capacitive resistance at a frequency of 50 Hz is thus in the range of 3 MΩ, for a frequency of 1000 Hz instead only 0.15 MΩ. In other words, significantly lower than its direct current voltage resistance. Nevertheless, it will in most cases be significantly higher than the resistance of the non-insulated bearing, which is only very low (1 Ω or less) at voltages above 1 V. ",

        "Within Schaeffler we can offer a wide range of Insutect A coating solutions. In most cases the insulation performance of the coating will be efficient enough, to prevent the bearing for harmful current flow damages. For extremely high electrical requirements and when the bearing size is not too large, hybrid ball bearings are the best solution."

Unfortunately it requires medium to high effort to determine these parameters, especially dynamic material parameters. The hardness of the material is easy to determine and known in most cases – so the idea of this tool is to give the user the chance to convert the hardness value of steels, cast irons and aluminums to static and dynamic material properties. The calculation is conservative and does not overestimate the material properties and is based on the FKM guideline “Analytical strength assessment of components” with some Schaeffler specific expansions for aluminums and high hardness steels.",

Depending on the selection, the fields for hardness or tensile strength are highlighted and you can type in your value or use the slider on the HV input box.",
        "For steels, the calculation of yield strength depends on the material annealing condition soft / normalized or hardened / quenched and tempered (QT). This information can be provided in the filed “estimation for condition”. If it is not set manually, it is assumed that hardness values over 300 HV are hardened or quenched and tempered. In the case of hardened and QT, the “hardness degree” is required if the calculation is based on hardness. Hardness degree is calculated using the maximum hardness calculation button where the carbon content of the steel of interest is required. Typical carbon values are 0,16 % for case hardening steels, 0,32-0,55 % for quenched and tempered steels and round about 1 % for bearing steels.

Quantitative kowledge about supplier-specific greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions is key for calculating product-specific footprints for our customers as well as Schaeffler's company-wide emissions - both topics of upmost importance today and tomorrow.",
        "<b>1. Initial situation</b>",
        "Schaeffler purchases over one million tons of steel per year. At the same time, over 300 different steel grades differing in chemical composition, metallurgical and/or mechanical properties are available for use in Schaeffler products. However, not every steel grade can be pruchased from every of our over 200 released suppliers. Only after a tight technical assessment by our steel supplier development department, a supplier is allowed to deliver a certain steel grade. This release might then be limited to certain production routes, steel plants, and product dimensions. Certain applications, such as for use in wind-power plants, additionally demand material purchase from suppliers with a long-term record of delivering high-quality material (see <a class=\"text-link hover:underline hover:cursor-pointer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sapdms.schaeffler.com:8080/jsf/dd.faces?sap=EP1&dokar=ASI&doknr=S266042&doktl=EN\">S 266042</a> for more information). Up to now, all these information have been collected in various Excel lists, making it comparably time-consuming and potentially error-prone to \"select the right supplier for the right material for the right application\".",
        "Besides the importance of supplier-specific information for the purchasing process, data on the suppliers' CO2e (or more generally greenhouse-gas, GHG) emissions is attracting more and more interest - both from our customers and from the general public. In this context, it is important to note that GHG emissions created during raw-material production typically contribute more than 70% to the product carbon footprints (PCF) of Schaeffler’s products. The precise knowledge of these so-called Scope 3.1 upstream emissions (for purchased goods and services) is therefore important both for assessing product-specific GHG footprints (via lifecycle assessment) and for reducing our overall emissions to reach our aim of climate neutrality by 2040. Typically, the values for GHG emissions range from a few hundred kg to several tons per ton of purchased material and depend on many details during the (raw) material production process. It is therefore generally not appropriate to use literature data or other averaged values for calculating GHG emissions as this data neglects the immense influence of supplier-specific production routes on the emitted GHGs.",

        "We integrated all above mentioned information of approved steel suppliers (maximum dimensions, release restrictions, supplier rating, supplier-specific GHG emission factors etc.) in one central database - the “Materials Supplier Database” (MSD). As of September 2022, the GHG emission factors of our most important steel suppliers can be found in the database; integration of other (raw) material classes, including aluminum, copper, ceramics, hard magnets, lubricants, polymers will take place later this year of early 2023. The Materials Supplier Database is integrated in the Materials App Center and available via web browser for daily work and purchasing decisions and as application programmable interface (API) for integration in PCF (product carbon footprint) calculation tools such as TcPCM or GaBi. Next, various extensions are planned, e.g. inclusion of non-steel materials, information about (the ISO 14067 conformity of) the calculation method used to derive the GHG emissions of the presented data, inclusion of historic evolution and/or future expectations of supplier-specific footprints.",

The availability of this data is key to reach our aim of climate neutrality by 2040 (because it is needed to steer purchasing decisions as well as design and material-selection considerations) and for maintaining or even improving our market position (by offering transparent, high-quality information about the PCFs of our products to our customers).",

      "subTitle": "Calculate analytical QM value and sum value",
      "content": [
        "When hardening steels, one must know, if a material can be fully hardened, i. e. the hardness on the surface as well as in the core of the material is the same. On many drawings the QM value (German for materialbezogener Querschnittswert, material-related cross-section value) can be found. In order to choose the right material for the part, a material must be chosen, where AQM > QM. The analytical QM value is a theoretical, calculated value, that gives something like the critical diameter of a part, but is actually not a measurable diameter. To calculate the AQM value, the chemical composition of a steel, i. e. the element contents of Carbon, Silicon, Manganese, Chromium, Molybdenum, and Nickel in weight percent, are consecutively entered in eight polynomial equations given in <a class=\"text-link hover:underline hover:cursor-pointer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sapdms.schaeffler.com:8080/jsf/dd.faces?sap=EP1&dokar=ASI&doknr=S130998&doktl=EN\">S 130998</a>. The final result is the AQM value, that can be compared to the QM values given on the drawings.",
        "Using the AQM Calculator you have different ways to enter your data. You can either select one of the predefined steel compositions from the drop-down list or enter the specific values in the six given input boxes. If you change the values in the input boxes, the drop-down list will contain “Custom alloy”. The values must be given in mass percent, as usual with steel compositions.",
        "The AQM value is then calculated together with the sum value of the contents of Cr, Mn and Si. This sum value is an indicator, how high the content of chemical elements are, that contribute when hardening the material. The technical delivery conditions for the respective materials have limit values for the sum value. Depending on the material, in the section Limits, below right, you can see if the limit for a certain material is reached or not. In the image you can see that the limit for 100Cr6 is reached, but not for the other materials.",
        "../../../assets/img/learnmore/aqm/aqm_1.png",
        "The calculation of the AQM value is primarily restricted to through-hardening steels (100Cr6, 100CrMnSi6-4, 100CrMo7-3, 100CrMnMoSi8-4-6, etc.), but also some other steel alloys (e. g. C80) might be correctly calculated as long as the element contents are in a certain range:",
        "C: 0.6 - 1.1<br>Si: 0.0 - 1.5<br>Mn: 0.0 - 1.5<br>Cr: 0.0 -2.0<br>Mo: 0.0 - 1.0<br>Ni: 0.0 -1.6",
        "Outside these ranges, the predictions are no longer valid and the tool will display a warning and not calculate or update the result.",
        "<b>Example</b>",
        "You have a material 100CrMnSi6-4 and the respective element content values, e. g. from a material certificate or a measurement. You enter the data in the input boxes (see image below). The chemical values are within the allowed limits of a 100CrMnSi6-4. The AQM value is calculated to be 62.7 and the sum value is 3.1. The sum value reaches the limits for 100Cr6, 100CrMo7 and 100CrMo7-3, indicated by a green check mark, but not for 100CrMnMoSi8-4-6 and 100CrMnSi6-4, indicated by a red exclamation mark. But as this material is 100CrMnSi6-4 the sum value is not reached for that material. The material might still be used for smaller parts, but one must think about it.",

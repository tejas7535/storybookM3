        "Current passage can occur in the use of rolling bearings in industrial and automotive applications. Under unfavorable conditions, this causes damage to raceways and rolling elements as well as degradation of the lubricant and thus to premature, unexpected failure of a motor or generator. In addition to the repair work required, this incurs additional costs due to machine downtime and lost production.",
        "It is significantly more cost-effective to provide for the use an electrically insulating product at the planning stage. As a result, customer benefit is increased through reduced maintenance costs and higher machine availability. Normally, it is sufficient to interrupt the circuit between the housing and shaft in order, depending on the application, to insert a current insulating solution at one or both bearing positions.",
        "<b>1 Initial situation</b>",
        "In general, it is difficult to eliminate the causes of electrical voltage in the rolling bearing. Nevertheless, bearing damage can be prevented if it is possible to stop or significantly reduce the flow of current. Essentially, three relevant types of current flow must be considered: capacitive currents, high-frequency circular currents and rotor-earth currents. Especially with inverter-powered motors, so-called parasitic effects can occur, which lead to damage on the rolling bearing.",

        "<i><b>Fig. 1</b> Types of current flow</i><br><br>",
        "The challenges for rolling bearings with current flow affects automotive and industrial applications equally. An Insutect A coating or a hybrid ball bearing offer protection. Until now, mainly bearings in industrial applications are protected against current flow. The following picture represents the different types of electricity according to the performance class for E-motors in industrial applications.",

The resistance value reach for the 700 µm coating up to 1000 MΩ and the breakthrough voltage is 6000 V. For voltages up to 1000 V this leads to a current of 1 µA through the bearing, which is absolutely uncritical. Even with the existing coating types we reach for voltages up to 1000V a current of only 20 µA. With the different coating types, we are ideally positioned for standard and premium requirements, where high resistance and breakthrough voltage is necessary.",

        "The insulated unit represents a capacitance C, which can accumulate charges. Under the influence of an alternating current voltage, this leads to an alternating current due to direct contact between the rolling element and raceway. For the effective values of current and voltage under a harmonic time curve with a pulsatance Ꞷ, the formula is: I = U · Ꞷ· C. The goal is to build a capacitance with a low value, so that less charges can be applied. For the 700 µm thick J20GG coating we reach values of nearly 1.1 nF. (Measured on Bearing type 6315). Its capacitive resistance at a frequency of 50 Hz is thus in the range of 3 MΩ, for a frequency of 1000 Hz instead only 0.15 MΩ. In other words, significantly lower than its direct current voltage resistance. Nevertheless, it will in most cases be significantly higher than the resistance of the non-insulated bearing, which is only very low (1 Ω or less) at voltages above 1 V. ",

Their direct current voltage resistance, even at high temperatures, is in the GΩ range. A typical value for capacitance is 40 pF and is thus, lower by a factor of 50-75, than Insutect A bearings with ceramic coating.",
        "<b>3 Conclusion</b>",
        "Within Schaeffler we can offer a wide range of Insutect A coating solutions. In most cases the insulation performance of the coating will be efficient enough, to prevent the bearing for harmful current flow damages. For extremely high electrical requirements and when the bearing size is not too large, hybrid ball bearings are the best solution."

        "Most important material parameters describing mechanical strength are the yield and tensile strength as well as dynamic material parameters like alternating tensile compressive strength. Unfortunately it requires medium to high effort to determine these parameters, especially dynamic material parameters. The hardness of the material is easy to determine and known in most cases – so the idea of this tool is to give the user the chance to convert the hardness value of steels, cast irons and aluminums to static and dynamic material properties. The calculation is conservative and does not overestimate the material properties and is based on the FKM guideline “Analytical strength assessment of components” with some Schaeffler specific expansions for aluminums and high hardness steels.",
        "The application is Matlab based and therefore running on the Schaeffler Matlab server. Starting the application requires a login to the Matlab server which is free using Schaeffler Windows ID and Windows password.",
        "After application start, you should first select the material type of interest (upper left – Material type). Steel, Cast iron and aluminum are available at the moment. Next, the basis for the estimation should be selected whether it is hardness or the ultimate tensile strength. Depending on the selection, the fields for hardness or tensile strength are highlighted and you can type in your value or use the slider on the HV input box.",
        "For steels, the calculation of yield strength depends on the material annealing condition soft / normalized or hardened / quenched and tempered (QT). This information can be provided in the filed “estimation for condition”. If it is not set manually, it is assumed that hardness values over 300 HV are hardened or quenched and tempered. In the case of hardened and QT, the “hardness degree” is required if the calculation is based on hardness. Hardness degree is calculated using the maximum hardness calculation button where the carbon content of the steel of interest is required. Typical carbon values are 0,16 % for case hardening steels, 0,32-0,55 % for quenched and tempered steels and round about 1 % for bearing steels. The WIAM database can be used to get information about chemical composition.",

Quantitative kowledge about supplier-specific greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions is key for calculating product-specific footprints for our customers as well as Schaeffler's company-wide emissions - both topics of upmost importance today and tomorrow.",
        "<b>1. Initial situation</b>",
        "Schaeffler purchases over one million tons of steel per year. At the same time, over 300 different steel grades differing in chemical composition, metallurgical and/or mechanical properties are available for use in Schaeffler products. However, not every steel grade can be pruchased from every of our over 200 released suppliers. Only after a tight technical assessment by our steel supplier development department, a supplier is allowed to deliver a certain steel grade. This release might then be limited to certain production routes, steel plants, and product dimensions. Certain applications, such as for use in wind-power plants, additionally demand material purchase from suppliers with a long-term record of delivering high-quality material (see <a class=\"text-link hover:underline hover:cursor-pointer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sapdms.schaeffler.com:8080/jsf/dd.faces?sap=EP1&dokar=ASI&doknr=S266042&doktl=EN\">S 266042</a> for more information). Up to now, all these information have been collected in various Excel lists, making it comparably time-consuming and potentially error-prone to \"select the right supplier for the right material for the right application\".",
        "Besides the importance of supplier-specific information for the purchasing process, data on the suppliers' CO2e (or more generally greenhouse-gas, GHG) emissions is attracting more and more interest - both from our customers and from the general public. In this context, it is important to note that GHG emissions created during raw-material production typically contribute more than 70% to the product carbon footprints (PCF) of Schaeffler’s products. The precise knowledge of these so-called Scope 3.1 upstream emissions (for purchased goods and services) is therefore important both for assessing product-specific GHG footprints (via lifecycle assessment) and for reducing our overall emissions to reach our aim of climate neutrality by 2040. Typically, the values for GHG emissions range from a few hundred kg to several tons per ton of purchased material and depend on many details during the (raw) material production process. It is therefore generally not appropriate to use literature data or other averaged values for calculating GHG emissions as this data neglects the immense influence of supplier-specific production routes on the emitted GHGs.",

        "<i>Company-wide GHG emissions by category (left) [Sustain] and overview of supplier-specific GHG emission factors (right)</i>",
        "<b>2. Solution</b>",
        "We integrated all above mentioned information of approved steel suppliers (maximum dimensions, release restrictions, supplier rating, supplier-specific GHG emission factors etc.) in one central database - the “Materials Supplier Database” (MSD). As of September 2022, the GHG emission factors of our most important steel suppliers can be found in the database; integration of other (raw) material classes, including aluminum, copper, ceramics, hard magnets, lubricants, polymers will take place later this year of early 2023. The Materials Supplier Database is integrated in the Materials App Center and available via web browser for daily work and purchasing decisions and as application programmable interface (API) for integration in PCF (product carbon footprint) calculation tools such as TcPCM or GaBi. Next, various extensions are planned, e.g. inclusion of non-steel materials, information about (the ISO 14067 conformity of) the calculation method used to derive the GHG emissions of the presented data, inclusion of historic evolution and/or future expectations of supplier-specific footprints.",

        "With the MSD we offer a reliable, available, integrable, and single source of truth for raw-material GHG emission factors. The availability of this data is key to reach our aim of climate neutrality by 2040 (because it is needed to steer purchasing decisions as well as design and material-selection considerations) and for maintaining or even improving our market position (by offering transparent, high-quality information about the PCFs of our products to our customers).",

        "<p>Hardness measurements are a very important means to ensure the reliability of Schaeffler products. Most products have a certain method for the hardness measurement given on the drawing or in product specific standards. However, sometimes it is necessary to convert hardness values from one measurement method to another, e.g. if the measurement method is not appropriate for the size or the material condition of the sample (see S&nbsp;266010 for details), or to estimate the ultimate tensile strength from hardness values, when it is not feasible to produce tensile specimen from the tested part. This is usually done using the conversion tables of different international standards, e. g. ISO 18265 or ASTM E140, if not integrated in the measuring device.</p>",
        "<p>Depending on the availability of the respective hardness methods in the respective tables, a conversion from and to Vickers (HV), Brinell (HB), Rockwell A (HRA), Rockwell B (HRB), Rockwell C (HRC) and the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) in MPa is often performed. The Hardness Converter App is the right place to perform such conversions.</p>",

        "<p>The Share button on the upper right corner, allows to send the link of the hardness converter to other users, without preserving already entered or converted hardness values.</p>",
        "<p>Clicking the Reset button at the bottom, resets the full user interface to its initial state.</p>",
        "<p>You should select the right conversion table from the dropdown box, in case the default value &quot;ISO 18265 table A.1&quot; is not the right one for your problem (see below).</p>",
        "<p>In case, the conversion cannot be performed, because the value is not in the range of the selected conversion table, the value will be presented as &quot;out-of-range&quot;, as a valid conversion result cannot be given. In case the chosen conversion table does not contain any data for converting your specific hardness values, because the hardness method is not given in the table, a &quot;not-in-table&quot; warning will be shown.</p>",
        "<p>The unit of the hardness value you enter must be chosen from the dropdown box. It is possible to enter multiple hardness values by clicking on the plus symbol next to the entry boxes. You can add as many hardness values as you desire. In that case the arithmetic mean value and the standard deviation is calculated (see below). The conversion then is done using the arithmetic mean value for all measurement methods in the Hardness Converter.</p>",
        "<p>The resulting conversion value can be copied to the clipboard by clicking on the clipboard symbol to the right of the values and can then be pasted in any Office document, email, or wherever you like.</p>",
        "<h1>Conversion Tables</h1>",
        "<p>The Hardness Converter allows the conversion of measured hardness values according to different hardness conversion tables from different standards. The following tables are implemented:</p>",
        "<ul> <li>ISO 18265, Table A.1 &mdash; Conversion of hardness-to-hardness or hardness-to-tensile-strength values for unalloyed and low alloy steels and cast steel</li>  <li>ISO 18265, Table B.2 &mdash; Conversion of hardness-to-hardness and hardness-to-tensile-strength values for quenching and tempering steels in the quenched tempered conditions</li>  <li>ISO 18265, Table B.3 &mdash; Conversion of hardness-to-hardness or hardness-to-tensile-strength values for quenching and tempering steels in the untreated, soft annealed or normalized conditions</li>  <li>ISO 18265, Table B.4 &mdash; Conversion of hardness-to-hardness values for quenching and tempering steels in the quenched condition</li>  <li>ISO 18265, Table C.2 &mdash; Conversion of hardness-to-hardness values for cold working steels</li>  <li>ISO 18265, Table F.1 &mdash; Nickel and High-Nickel Alloys</li>  <li>ISO 18265, Table F.2 &mdash; Cartridge brass (70 % Copper, 30 % Zinc Alloy)</li>  <li>ISO 18265, Table F.4 &mdash; Wrought Aluminium Products</li>  <li>ISO 18265, Table F.5 &mdash; Aluminium and its Alloys</li>  <li>ASTM E140, Table 1 Approximate Hardness Conversion Numbers for Non-Austenitic Steels (Rockwell C Hardness Range)</li>  <li>ASTM E140, Table 3 Approximate Hardness Conversion Numbers for Nickel and High-Nickel Alloys</p>  <li>ASTM E140, Table 4 Approximate Hardness Conversion Numbers for Cartridge Brass (70 % Copper 30 % Zinc Alloy)</li>  <li>ASTM E140, Table 9 Approximate Hardness Conversion Numbers for Wrought Aluminum Products</li>  <li>Schaeffler, Internal conversion rule for oil tempered spring steel</li></ul>",
        "<p>Depending on the availability of the respective hardness methods in the respective tables, a conversion from and to Vickers (HV), Brinell (HB), Rockwell A (HRA), Rockwell B (HRB), and Rockwell C (HRC) and the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) in MPa is performed. The conversion is using the widest range possible, i. e. the conversion also includes values outside the recommended range of the respective hardness method, because they are commonly used in practice (usually set in parenthesis in the conversion tables of the respective standards). For example HRC values below 20&nbsp;HRC can be converted using ISO 18265 table B.2. In case of Brinell hardness conversions, the conversion follows Brinell hardness values using the tungsten carbide tip (HBW). This is only relevant for hardness values above roughly 450 HB, as above 450 HB hardness values measured with a steel and the tungsten carbide tip differ, as the steel ball itself is being deformed with such hard materials.</p>",
        "<p>When performing a hardness conversion, the right conversion table must be chosen. The most universal conversion table for steel is ISO 18265 table A.1, which is the default value. However, when having different material types (e. g. aluminium, brass, a high-alloyed steel) or a heat-treated or cold-worked material, make sure to select the right conversion table. When performing a conversion for surface hardened steels, for case-hardened, carbonitrided, nitrided or nitrocarburised parts, multi-phase (e. g. duplex steels) or deformation hardening steels or materials (e. g. TRIP or TWIP steels), cast iron or other non-iron metals, great care must be used in choosing the right table and interpreting the results. The standard conversion tables may not be suited for these special cases.</p>",
        "<h1>Plausibility Check</h1>",
        "<p>In case multiple values are given, the Hardness Converter checks the values for plausibility. Therefore, it considers the measurements as a series of measurements on one and the same part and performs a repeat precision check according S&nbsp;285018, as it is done with calibration plates. In case the multiple hardness values do not comply with the repeatability test, a short warning message appears. The warning is just a reminder for the user to check if the measurements are plausible, i. e. a measurement might result in a warning, but due to locally changing microstructure (e. g. local Pearlite formation in Martensite) the measurement might still be correct. As the repeat precision is also dependent on some other factors, and in order to keep the hardness converter simple, only some repeat precision values were chosen. In case some special rules apply (e. g. micro hardness testing), think about results and possible different repeat precision ranges.</p>",
        "<p>The following repeat precisions were implemented (H&#773;: average hardness value):</p>",

        "<h1>Geometrical Parameter of the Indentations and Correctional Functions</h1>",
        "<p>It is often of importance, to know the geometrical appearance of the indentations. Depending on the hardness measurement method chosen, additional parameters must be given, like e. g. the indentation force and the indenter geometry.</p>",
        "<p>The diameter of an indentation has an influence on the inter-indentations spacing <i>d<sub>indent</sub></i> of indentations as well as the necessary edge distance <i>d<sub>edge</sub></i> of the indents. These are relevant, to ensure that it is a valid hardness indentation. The Hardness Converter calculates the minimum allowed inter-indentation and edge indentation spacing according to the given hardness value, the applied test force and the given indenter type. An indentation is valid, if the actual distances are greater or equal to the calculated values.</p>",
        "%ASSETS/img/hc/HC_indents_dim.png",
        "<p>Additionally the part must have a certain thickness <i>t</i>. If it is too thin, the measured hardness value might not only be related to the part, but also to the underlying material. The thickness refers to a zone of constant hardness in the material. It can either be the actual thickness of the part (e. g. sheet thickness), the thickness of a coating or the thickness of a surface hardened zone (e. g. by induction or case hardening). As Vickers is most commonly used to measure surface hardness values, the maximum indentation force will be calculated for Vickers, when the thickness is given. If a value of e. g. F<sub>max</sub> = 3.5 kp is calculated, the force of 3.5 kp should not be exceeded, so it would be save to use HV3 or lower for measuring the hardness. As measuring hardness values has already quite some history, the forces are given in the old unit kilopond for Vickers, Brinell and Rockwell, where 1 kp = 1 kgf = 9.81 N. This makes it simpler to apply the values in practise.</p>",
        "<p>If hardness values must be obtained on cylindrical or spherical either convex or concave parts, the measured hardness values must be corrected by a certain factor or summand, depending on the hardness value and curvature of the object. For a better understanding, the following table depicts the different cases of indentations in concave and convex cylindrical or spherical parts.</p>",

        "<p>Therefore the Hardness Converter can estimate the geometric parameters of hardness indentations and the inter-indentation spacing, the edge distance spacing, the correction values for hardness measurements on cylindrical or spherical parts, if applicable.

        "<p>The repeat precision for Brinell is at that load level at 3&nbsp;%, resulting in &asymp; 6&nbsp;HB allowance. When entering the values mentioned above, a warning message appears, as the maximum value of 207&nbsp;HB is out of the range: the difference between maximum and minimum value is larger than the allowance (207&nbsp;HB - 200&nbsp;HB = 7&nbsp;HB &gt; 6&nbsp;HB). This reminds you to check and verify the value of 207&nbsp;HB.</p>",
        "<i><b>Example 2</i></b>",

You just have to enter 400&nbsp;HV, expand the geometry tab and enter the indentation force of 30&nbsp;kp (for HV30), the part diameter of 15&nbsp;mm and the desired CHD of 0.5&nbsp;mm.</p>",

If the indentation diagonals are oriented about 45&deg; to the axis of the wire, the actual hardness of the part is 394&nbsp;HV30. From the given CHD of 0.5&nbsp;mm, the maximum test force is calculated. As the maximum allowed test force for such a small CHD is &asymp; 24&nbsp;kp, but the actual test force used is 30&nbsp;kp, the warning &quot;Applied test force is higher than maximum allowed test force.&quot; is given.

        "When hardening steels, one must know, if a material can be fully hardened, i. e. the hardness on the surface as well as in the core of the material is the same. On many drawings the QM value (German for materialbezogener Querschnittswert, material-related cross-section value) can be found. In order to choose the right material for the part, a material must be chosen, where AQM > QM. The analytical QM value is a theoretical, calculated value, that gives something like the critical diameter of a part, but is actually not a measurable diameter. To calculate the AQM value, the chemical composition of a steel, i. e. the element contents of Carbon, Silicon, Manganese, Chromium, Molybdenum, and Nickel in weight percent, are consecutively entered in eight polynomial equations given in <a class=\"text-link hover:underline hover:cursor-pointer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sapdms.schaeffler.com:8080/jsf/dd.faces?sap=EP1&dokar=ASI&doknr=S130998&doktl=EN\">S 130998</a>.

This sum value is an indicator, how high the content of chemical elements are, that contribute when hardening the material. The technical delivery conditions for the respective materials have limit values for the sum value. Depending on the material, in the section Limits, below right, you can see if the limit for a certain material is reached or not.

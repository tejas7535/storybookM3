Please consider the information in TPI 176 'Lubrication of Rolling Bearings' regarding the design of the bearing environment in the case of a vertical shaft position, as lubricant loss can occur more frequently.\n\n Due to the increased lubricant loss, it is necessary to carry out re-lubrication at shorter intervals and to compensate for the lubricant loss promptly. Since this is often difficult to achieve manually, the use of an automatic lubricant dispenser is recommended. The amount of lubricant per unit of time is slightly increased.\n If you have questions regarding your specific application, please contact Technical Support."

    "schaefflerDataPrivacy": "<h3>Privacy Policy</h3><h5>  We appreciate your interest in the Schaeffler Group (Schaeffler AG and related  companies) and our products. When using our online offers, the protection of  your privacy is of great importance. If personal data is processed, we comply  with the applicable data protection regulations.</h5><h5>I. General information about data processing</h5><h5>1. Scope and purpose of processing of personal data</h5><p>  As a matter of principle, we collect and use your personal data only to the  extent that this is necessary for the provision of a functioning website and  the content and services offered on the website. The collection and use of  your personal data regularly take place only after your consent. An exception  applies in those cases where the processing of the data is permitted by law.</p><h5>2. Legal basis for data processing.</h5><p>  Your personal data is processed on the basis of the EU General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR) and the applicable local data protection law. Insofar as you  have given us consent to process personal data for specific purposes, Art. 6  (1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data.  Consent given can be revoked by you at any time. Please note that the  revocation is only effective for the future. Processing that took place before  the revocation is not affected. Processing of personal data in the context of  the performance of a contract to which you are a party or in order to take  steps prior to entering a contract at your request is based on Art. 6 (1)(b)  GDPR. The purposes of data processing are governed by the respective contract  documents and the subject matter of the contract. If processing of personal  data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject,  Art. 6 (1)(c) GDPR serves as a legal basis. If processing is necessary for the  purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Schaeffler or by a third party  (e.g., to assert legal claims and defend against legal disputes; to ensure IT  security; to prevent criminal acts; for business management measures) and if  your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms as data subject do not  override the aforementioned interest, Art. 6 (1)(f)GDPR serves as the legal  basis for processing.</p><h5>3. Data erasure and retention period</h5><p>  We process and store your personal data for as long as this is necessary to  satisfy the respective purpose. In addition, such storage may take place in  order to comply with a legal obligation by Union or Member State law,  regulation or other provision to which we as controller are subject. If the  data is no longer necessary or if a retention period prescribed by the  aforementioned laws has expired, your data will be erased regularly after 90  days.</p><h5>  4. Access to personal data within the Schaeffler Group and by third parties</h5><p>  Within the Schaeffler Group, those entities gain access to your data who  require it as a part of “least privilege” (assignment of user rights to the  lowest possible extent) and the “need-to-know” principle (knowledge of data  only if necessary). We may only transfer data to third parties outside the  Schaeffler Group if this is necessary, if statutory provision so requires, you  have consented or processors engaged by us have contractually agreed to comply  with the requirements of the GDPR and applicable local data protection law.</p><p>  Under these circumstances, recipients of personal data may include: Microsoft  as a provider of Azure, Google as the provider of Firebase Analytics (mobile applications).</p><h5>  5. Transfer of personal data to a third country or to an international  organization</h5><p>  A transfer of data to countries outside the EU/EEA (so-called third countries)  will only take place as it is necessary or required by law, you have given  your consent or as part of data processing by a processor. If service  providers in third countries are deployed, in addition to written  instructions, they are required to comply with data protection standards in  Europe by agreeing on the EU standard contractual clauses.</p><h5>6. IT Security</h5><p>  The Schaeffler Group uses technical and organizational security measures to  protect the data we have under our control against accidental or intentional  destruction, manipulation, loss or against access by unauthorized persons.  These security measures are constantly being further developed in accordance  with the respective new technical possibilities.</p><p>  Our websites may contain links to websites of other providers. Our information  on data protection does not apply to these websites.</p><h5>7. Obligation to provide personal data</h5><p>  If we provide you with offers and services on this website that you can use  voluntarily, there is no obligation to provide us with your data, but without  your personal data you may not be able to use our offers and services.</p><h5>8. “Profiling“ and automated decision-making</h5><p>  We do not use fully automated decision-making pursuant to Art. 22 GDPR.  Schaeffler basically does not use “profiling”. If we use it in individual  cases, we will inform you about this separately, if it is required by law and  – if necessary - obtain your prior consent.</p><h5>9. Sources of your personal data</h5><p>We use data that we receive from you yourself.</p><h5>  II. Data processing operations during the provision of the application and  during the creation of log files.</h5><p>  When you visit our application, our web servers record and collect the name of  your Internet service provider, your IP address, the website from which you  visit us, the web pages you visit on our site, and the date and duration of  your visit as standard. This data is stored in the log files of our systems.  However, the use of the IP address is limited to the technically necessary  extent and is shortened and thus only used anonymously, so that an assignment  of the IP address to a user is not possible. The data is not linked to  personal data.</p><p>  The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f  GDPR.</p><p>  The temporary storage of the abbreviated IP address by our systems is  technically necessary to enable delivery of the application to your terminal  device. Storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the  website. Data is not being analysed for marketing purposes in this context.  For these purposes, we have legitimate interest in processing of data  according to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.</p><p>  The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of  data in log files is essential for the operation of the website. Therefore,  there is no possibility for you as a user to object to such processing.</p><h5>III. Data processing for services offered on the website</h5><p>  On our website we offer several services which will request personal data in  case you use them. The transmission of personal data is always voluntary.</p><p>  In this context, we process your personal data exclusively on an anonymous  basis to enable, for example, the following evaluations: </br>With the Grease Application, calculations are carried out through user input such as bearing selection and operating parameters in order to determine a lubricant recommendation and issue application recommendations.</br>Your anonymized user data is stored on the Microsoft Azure platform and displayed in the form of a dashboard. For our mobile applications (Grease App on Android and iOS), the data is collected by the Firebase Platform (Google), according to your opt-in status. This gives us the opportunity to evaluate user behavior in the Grease Application in order to be able to make strategic decisions about the further development of the Grease Application.</p><h5>IV.

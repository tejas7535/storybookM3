Schaeffler does not accept any liability in relation to the uninterrupted availability of the Schaeffler App.</p><p>The Schaeffler App can be used to calculate the lubricant quantity for bearings during initial greasing and relubrication under specific operating conditions. In addition, recommendations for relubrication intervals and grease usage durations are provided. Relubrication can be carried out manually or automatically using the Schaeffler lubricators. The user is given an overview of the properties of the Arcanol greases. Greases with a high relubrication interval are highlighted.</p><h5>3. Rights of Use</h5><b>3.1</b><p>The use of the information, software and documentation available on the Schaeffler App shall be subjected to these Conditions, or if the information, software and documentation are updated, such shall be subject to the applicable license conditions already agreed with Schaeffler.

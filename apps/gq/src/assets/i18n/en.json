The protection of your privacy when using our online offer is very important for us. If personal data is processed, we observe the applicable data protection laws.</h5><br><h5>I. General information about data processing</h5><h5>1. Scope and purpose of processing of personal data</h5><p>In principle, we collect and use your personal data only insofar as it is necessary to provide a functional website as well as our content and services offered on the website. The processing of your personal data takes place either on the basis of your consent or insofar as the legal regulations allow this data processing even without consent.</p><h5>2. Legal basis for data processing.</h5><p>Your personal data is processed on the basis of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the applicable local data protection law, f.e. the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). Insofar as you have given us consent to process personal data for specific purposes, Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data. Consent given can be revoked by you at any time. Please note that the revocation is only effective for the future. Processing that took place before the revocation is not affected. Processing of personal data in the context of the performance of a contract to which you are a party or in order to take steps prior to entering a contract at your request is based on Art. 6 (1)(b) GDPR. The purposes of data processing are governed by the respective contract documents and the subject matter of the contract. If processing of personal data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject, Art. 6 (1)(c) GDPR serves as a legal basis. If processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Schaeffler or by a third party (e.g., to assert legal claims and defend against legal disputes; to ensure IT security; to prevent criminal acts; for business management measures) and if your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms as data subject do not override the aforementioned interest, Art. 6 (1)(f)GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing.</p><h5>3. Data erasure and retention period</h5><p>We process and store your personal data for as long as this is necessary to satisfy the respective purpose. In addition, such storage may take place in order to comply with a legal obligation by Union or Member State law, regulation or other provision to which we as controller are subject. If the data is no longer necessary or if a retention period prescribed by the aforementioned laws has expired, your data will be erased. In order to maintain comparability and transparency with regard to the offer and sales history, your data will be deleted after 10 years.</p><h5>4. Access to personal data within the Schaeffler Group and by third parties</h5><p>Within the Schaeffler Group, those entities gain access to your data who require it as a part of “least privilege” (assignment of user rights to the lowest possible extent) and the “need-to-know” principle (knowledge of data only if necessary). We may only transfer data to third parties outside the Schaeffler Group if this is necessary, if statutory provision so requires, you have consented or processors engaged by us have contractually agreed to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and applicable local data protection law.</p><p>UUnder these circumstances, recipients of personal data may include: Responsible internal depart-ments such as the project team “Guided Quoting” and the external service provider “Microsoft”, if required.</p><h5>5. Transfer of personal data to a third country or to an international organization</h5><p>A transfer of data to countries outside the EU/EEA (so-called third countries) will only take place as it is necessary or required by law, you have given your consent or as part of data processing by a processor. If service providers in third countries are deployed, in addition to written instructions, they are required to comply with data protection standards in Europe by agreeing on the EU standard contractual clauses.</p><h5>6. IT Security</h5><p>The Schaeffler Group uses technical and organizational security measures to protect the data we have under our control against accidental or intentional destruction, manipulation, loss or against access by unauthorized persons. These security measures are constantly being further developed in accordance with the respective new technical possibilities.</p><h5>7. Obligation to provide personal data</h5><p>While entering into a contract, you must provide the personal data that is necessary to establish, implement and terminate the contract and to satisfy the resulting duties or that Schaeffler must collect due to legal provisions. Without this data, no contract with Schaeffler is concluded. If we provide you with offers and services on this website that you can voluntarily use, there is no duty to provide your data to us, but without your personal data, you may not be able to use our offers and services.</p><h5>8. “Profiling“ and automated decision-making</h5><p>We do not use fully automated decision-making pursuant to Art. 22 GDPR. Schaeffler basically does not use “profiling”. If we use it in individual cases, we will inform you about this separately, if it is required by law and – if necessary - obtain your prior consent.</p><h5>9. Sources of your personal data</h5><p>We use data that we receive from you. We also use data that we receive from the following sys-tems:<ul><li>Azure AD</li><li>SAP</li></ul></p><h5>II. Data processing operations during the provision of the application and during the creation of log files.</h5><p>When you visit our application, our web servers record and collect the name of your Internet service provider, your IP address, the website from which you visit us, the web pages you visit on our site, and the date and duration of your visit. This data is stored in the log files of our systems and is used for problem or error analysis. However, the use of the IP address is limited to the technically necessary extent and is shortened and thus only used anonymously, so that it is not possible to assign the IP address to a user. The data is not merged with personal data.</p><p>The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p><p>The temporary storage of the abbreviated IP address by our systems is technically necessary to display the website to your terminal device. Storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the website. Data is not being analyzed for marketing purposes in this context. For these purposes, we have legitimate interest in processing of data according to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.</p><p>The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of data in log files is essential for the operation of the website. Therefore, there is no possibility for you as a user to object to such processing.</p><h5>III. Data processing for services offered on the website</h5><p>On our website various services are offered, for the use of which we request personal data from you. In this context, it is always optional for you to provide us with personal data. In Guided Quot-ing, your user abbreviation is stored in order to enable transparency with regard to the preparation of offers.<h5>1. Creation of a user profile</h5><p>We process your data to create a user profile. This is used to check the authorization in the application.</p><p>The legal basis for the processing of your personal data after registration is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p><p>The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. Therefore, the data is stored as long as your consent to data tracking is active.At any time you have the possibility to revoke your consent to the processing of personal data by e-mail to unsubscribe@schaeffler.com or by clicking on the „unsubscribe link” in the received mes-sages with effect for the future and thereby unsubscribe from the data tracking. In this case, all personal data stored in the course of contacting us will be deleted. The revocation of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revoca-tion.</p><h5>2. Data processing for orders and changes</h5><p>Within the quotation process, it is necessary to assign the corresponding documents to an employ-ee. In addition to the employee abbreviation, their first and last name are also stored. This process follows the official sales process according to the management manual (PD3.3 Quotation prepara-tion and submittal). In order to enable an offer traceability, your data will continue to be stored even after the offer has been submitted. For the authorization check and change history, the saved quotation creation is passed on to the SAP system together with your abbreviation.</p><h5>IV.

<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<h5>
  We appreciate your interest in the Schaeffler Group (Schaeffler AG and related
  companies) and our products. When using our online offers, the protection of
  your privacy is of great importance. If personal data is processed, we comply
  with the applicable data protection regulations.
</h5>

<h5>I. General information about data processing</h5>

<h5>1. Scope and purpose of processing of personal data</h5>
<p>
  As a matter of principle, we collect and use your personal data only to the
  extent that this is necessary for the provision of a functioning website and
  the content and services offered on the website. The collection and use of
  your personal data regularly take place only after your consent. An exception
  applies in those cases where the processing of the data is permitted by law. >
</p>
<h5>2. Legal basis for data processing.</h5>
<p>
  Your personal data is processed on the basis of the EU General Data Protection
  Regulation (GDPR) and the applicable local data protection law. Insofar as you
  have given us consent to process personal data for specific purposes, Art. 6
  (1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data.
  Consent given can be revoked by you at any time. Please note that the
  revocation is only effective for the future. Processing that took place before
  the revocation is not affected. Processing of personal data in the context of
  the performance of a contract to which you are a party or in order to take
  steps prior to entering a contract at your request is based on Art. 6 (1)(b)
  GDPR. The purposes of data processing are governed by the respective contract
  documents and the subject matter of the contract. If processing of personal
  data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject,
  Art. 6 (1)(c) GDPR serves as a legal basis. If processing is necessary for the
  purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Schaeffler or by a third party
  (e.g., to assert legal claims and defend against legal disputes; to ensure IT
  security; to prevent criminal acts; for business management measures) and if
  your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms as data subject do not
  override the aforementioned interest, Art. 6 (1)(f)GDPR serves as the legal
  basis for processing.
</p>
<h5>3. Data erasure and retention period</h5>
<p>
  We process and store your personal data for as long as this is necessary to
  satisfy the respective purpose. In addition, such storage may take place in
  order to comply with a legal obligation by Union or Member State law,
  regulation or other provision to which we as controller are subject. If the
  data is no longer necessary or if a retention period prescribed by the
  aforementioned laws has expired, your data will be erased regularly after 90
  days.
</p>

<h5>
  4. Access to personal data within the Schaeffler Group and by third parties
</h5>
<p>
  Within the Schaeffler Group, those entities gain access to your data who
  require it as a part of “least privilege” (assignment of user rights to the
  lowest possible extent) and the “need-to-know” principle (knowledge of data
  only if necessary). We may only transfer data to third parties outside the
  Schaeffler Group if this is necessary, if statutory provision so requires, you
  have consented or processors engaged by us have contractually agreed to comply
  with the requirements of the GDPR and applicable local data protection law.
</p>
<p>
  Under these circumstances, recipients of personal data may include:
  Responsible internal departments and external service providers if required.
</p>
<h5>
  5. Transfer of personal data to a third country or to an international
  organization
</h5>
<p>
  A transfer of data to countries outside the EU/EEA (so-called third countries)
  will only take place as it is necessary or required by law, you have given
  your consent or as part of data processing by a processor. If service
  providers in third countries are deployed, in addition to written
  instructions, they are required to comply with data protection standards in
  Europe by agreeing on the EU standard contractual clauses.
</p>
<h5>6. IT Security</h5>
<p>
  The Schaeffler Group uses technical and organizational security measures to
  protect the data we have under our control against accidental or intentional
  destruction, manipulation, loss or against access by unauthorized persons.
  These security measures are constantly being further developed in accordance
  with the respective new technical possibilities.
</p>
<p>
  Our websites may contain links to websites of other providers. Our privacy
  policy does not apply to these websites.
</p>
<h5>7. Obligation to provide personal data</h5>
<p>
  If we provide you with offers and services on this website that you can use
  voluntarily, there is no obligation to provide us with your data, but without
  your personal data you may not be able to use our offers and services.
</p>
<h5>8. “Profiling“ and automated decision-making</h5>
<p>
  We do not use fully automated decision-making pursuant to Art. 22 GDPR.
  Schaeffler basically does not use “profiling”. If we use it in individual
  cases, we will inform you about this separately, if it is required by law and
  – if necessary - obtain your prior consent.
</p>
<h5>9. Sources of your personal data</h5>
<p>We use data that we receive from you yourself.</p>
<h5>
  II. Data processing operations during the provision of the application and
  during the creation of log files.
</h5>
<p>
  When you visit our application, our web servers record and collect the name of
  your Internet service provider, your IP address, the website from which you
  visit us, the web pages you visit on our site, and the date and duration of
  your visit as standard. This data is stored in the log files of our systems.
  However, the use of the IP address is limited to the technically necessary
  extent and is shortened and thus only used anonymously, so that an assignment
  of the IP address to a user is not possible. The data is not linked to
  personal data.
</p>
<p>
  The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f
  GDPR.
</p>
<p>
  The temporary storage of the abbreviated IP address by our systems is
  technically necessary to enable delivery of the application to your terminal
  device. Storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the
  website. Data is not being analysed for marketing purposes in this context.
  For these purposes, we have legitimate interest in processing of data
  according to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
</p>
<p>
  The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of
  data in log files is essential for the operation of the website. Therefore,
  there is no possibility for you as a user to object to such processing.
</p>
<h5>III. Data processing for services offered on the website</h5>
<p>
  On our website we offer several services which will request personal data in
  case you use them. The transmission of personal data is always voluntary.
</p>
<p>
  In this context, we process your personal data exclusively on an anonymous
  basis to enable, for example, the following evaluations:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Analysis of request rates, response times and error rates of the website, to
    find out which pages are used most often during the day and from which
    locations users are.
  </li>
  <li>Evaluation of page views and loading performance of the website</li>
  <li>Evaluation of the number of users and sessions.</li>
  <li>Evaluation of custom events and metrics, such as games sold or won.</li>
</ul>
<h5>1. Ordering of publications</h5>

  and stored there as well. The date and time of the entry will also be stored
  when your order is sent. Your consent will be obtained for the processing of
  the data during the ordering process. PVS will print and send the ordered
  publication directly to you. The personal data will be used by us and pvs
  exclusively to perform your order.
</p>
<p>
  The legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDRP.
</p>
<p>
  The personal data and the additional data collected during the ordering
  process are deleted after six months. The deletion at PVS takes place after
  the ordering and shipping process has been completed and there are no longer
  any statutory retention periods.

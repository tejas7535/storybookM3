    General Description on calculation methodology for production and product

  </h3>
  <p>
    <span class="text-primary font-medium">Schaeffler</span> estimates the
    Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) related to rolling bearings based on used
    material and energy resources. The approximated equivalent CO₂ emissions
    (CO₂e) include the effect of carbon emissions as well as other greenhouse
    gases such as methane or nitrogen oxides, according to their individual
    contribution to the global warming potential (GWP100). Please be aware that
    the tool has not been certified in accordance with ISO 14040/44/67 or any
    other standard on the calculation of CO₂ emissions.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's important to note that all calculated PCF values are estimates
    resulting from input data of the user, implicitly used data of the
    calculation tool, general assumptions of the calculation methods. Therefore,
    the values calculated by
    <span class="text-primary font-medium">Schaeffler</span> should not be
    compared with PCF values obtained from other tools or sources unless you are
    confident about the data sources, methods and assumptions used.
  </p>
  <p>
    Changes in data or the calculation methodology may lead to significantly
    different results.
    <span class="text-primary font-medium">Schaeffler</span> assumes no

    its fitness for any particular purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="text-primary font-medium">Schaeffler</span> provides only
    estimated CO₂e emission values related to rolling bearing production phase
    (“cradle-to-gate”) and to rolling bearing operation (“product use”)
    according to the EPD product category rules “Bearings, bearing units and
    parts thereof (PCR 2023:03)”. Further emissions of other downstream
    processes (e.g., end-of-life processes) are not included in the calculation.
    The basic assumptions for a calculation are explained in the following
    chapters.

    Emissions related to rolling bearing production phase (“cradle-to-gate”)
  </h2>
  <p>
    In summary, the <span class="text-primary font-medium">Schaeffler</span> PCF
    values “cradle-to-gate” are estimated by multiplying an average factor based
    on the total CO₂e emissions of rolling bearing production of a reference
    period and the total weight of a produced rolling bearing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Due to the simplified top-down calculation approach, it can only provide a
    first indication of the PCF of an individual rolling bearing, which may
    deviate significantly on a case-by-case basis from the calculated average
    value. Main reasons for this include but are not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The actual steel making process used for the individual rolling bearing
    </li>
    <li>
      The regional energy mix at suppliers’ sites producing raw materials /
      intermediates
    </li>
    <li>
      The regional energy mix at Schaeffler plants producing the finished
      rolling bearing
    </li>
    <li>
      The heat treatment, machining, and final assembly of the individual
      rolling bearing
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The average factor for rolling bearing production determined for the
    <span class="font-medium text-primary">reference year 2024</span> is set to
    <span class="font-medium text-primary"
      >3.9 kg CO₂e per kg of produced rolling bearing weight</span
    >. This includes CO₂e emissions from Schaeffler operations, purchased
    energy, and the purchased goods used for rolling bearing manufacturing
    including upstream transportation and distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Individually calculated PCF values cradle-to-gate currently vary between 1.6
    … 7.9 kg CO₂e per kg of produced rolling bearing weight, reflecting above
    mentioned reasons.
  </p>
  <p>
    The PCF is mainly driven by processing of rolling bearing steel as the
    predominant material used for bearings, but also other material categories
    for bearings, such as brass or plastics, are taken into consideration.
  </p>
  <h2 id="downstreamSection">
    Emissions related to rolling bearing operation (“product use”)
  </h2>
  <p>
    In summary, the <span class="text-primary">Schaeffler</span> PCF values for
    the “product use” are estimated by multiplying the mechanical drive power to
    overcome the friction of a rolling bearing, the operating time and the
    emission factor of the drive energy source.
  </p>
  <p>
    The frictional power losses are affected by the rolling bearing design,
    operating conditions and lubrication. To estimate these power losses, the
    PCF calculation provides results based on the established friction
    calculation method as implemented in the
    <span class="text-primary">Schaeffler</span> analysis and design tool
    Bearinx and our externally provided tools
    <span class="text-primary">Bearinx-online Easy Friction</span> and
    <span class="text-primary">Bearinx-online Rotative</span>. Thus, the power
    losses calculation considers:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Internal design of rolling bearings</li>
    <li>Speed and load of rolling bearings</li>
    <li>Oil and grease lubrication</li>
    <li>Rolling and sliding losses</li>
    <li>Mixed friction and full film lubrication</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The emission factors are used as published in the latest VDA report
    “Emission factors for electricity, district heating, and fuels (updated
    09/2024)”. They will be updated with every new release of the report. The
    emission factors refer to the CO₂e emissions per energy provided by the
    corresponding energy source. The efficiencies of any energy conversions are
    neglected.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that the calculated CO₂e emissions refer to the use of the
    rolling bearing system and can only be used for a first estimation. Under
    real operating conditions, significant deviations may occur due to
    unforeseeable circumstances. Further, the following simplifications are made
    to enable a quick and easy-to-use calculation:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Standard operating clearance and mounting conditions</li>
    <li>Stationary operating conditions</li>
    <li>No tilting of the shaft and with rigid housings</li>
    <li>Speed and load are only applied to the inner ring</li>
    <li>
      The internal axial force (e.g. for tapered roller bearings) or the preload
      in the case of arranged bearings, must be compensated with externally
      applied axial loads in order to be correctly taken into account
    </li>
    <li>
      Very good lubrication and heat dissipation are assumed. This is
      particularly important for combined loaded cylindrical roller bearings
    </li>
    <li>
      The minimum load for thrust bearings is calculated for the highest speed
      of all load cases
    </li>
    <li>The raceways for cage assemblies are manufactured as specified</li>
  </ul>

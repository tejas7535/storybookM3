  General Description on calculation methodology for cradle-to-gate
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  Schaeffler estimates the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) related to rolling
  bearings based on used material and energy resources. In detail, the
  equivalent CO2 emissions (CO2e) are calculated, which include the effect of
  carbon emissions as well as other greenhouse gases such as methane or nitrogen
  oxides, according to their individual contribution to the global warming
  potential (GWP100). Please be aware that the tool has not been certified in
  accordance with ISO 14040/44 or any other standard on the calculation of CO2
  emissions.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  It's important to note that all calculated PCF values are estimates resulting
  from user input data and assumptions combined with calculation methods and
  both internal and external data. Therefore, the values calculated by
  Schaeffler should not be compared with PCF values obtained from other tools or
  sources unless you are confident about the data sources, methods and
  assumptions used.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  The tool provides estimated CO2e emission values for the bearing production
  phase.

  Emissions related to bearing production phase (cradle-to-gate)
</h6>

<p class="mb-4">
  In summary, the PCF values cradle-to-gate are the result of a simplified
  calculation using an average factor based on the total CO2e emissions of
  bearing production in relation to the total weight of produced bearings in a
  reference time period.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  The Schaeffler PCF value is calculated by multiplying this average factor with
  the finished weight of the selected bearing. Due to its simplified top-down
  calculation approach, it can only provide a first indication of the real PCF
  of an individual bearing, which may deviate on a case-by-case basis
  substantially from the calculated average value. Main reasons for this include
  but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the actual steel making process used for the individual bearing</li>
  <li>
    the regional energy mix at suppliers' sites producing raw materials /
    intermediates
  </li>
  <li>
    the regional energy mix at Schaeffler plants producing the finished bearing
  </li>
  <li>
    the heat treatment, machining and final assembly of the individual bearing
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4">
  The average factor for rolling bearing production determined for the reference
  year 2021 is set to 3.0 kg CO2e per kg of produced bearing weight. This
  includes CO2e emissions from Schaeffler operations (GHG Protocol, Scope 1),
  purchased energy (GHG Protocol, Scope 2), and the purchased goods used for
  bearing manufacturing including upstream transportation and distribution (GHG
  Protocol, Scope 3 Upstream).
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  The PCF is mainly driven by the processing of bearing steel as the predominant
  material used for rolling bearings. CO2e emissions of other materials used in
  bearings, such as brass or plastics, are considered to have similar values as
  steel at first approximation.

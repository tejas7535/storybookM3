    estimates the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) related to rolling bearings
    based on used material and energy resources. In detail, the equivalent CO2
    emissions (CO2e) are calculated, which include the effect of carbon
    emissions as well as other greenhouse gases such as methane or nitrogen
    oxides, according to their individual contribution to the global warming
    potential (GWP100). Please be aware that the tool has not been certified in
    accordance with ISO 14040/44 or any other standard on the calculation of CO2
    emissions.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's important to note that all calculated PCF values are estimates
    resulting from user input data and assumptions combined with calculation
    methods and both internal and external data. There-fore, the values
    calculated by
    <span class="text-primary font-medium">Schaeffler</span> should not be
    compared with PCF values obtained from other tools or sources unless you are
    confident about the data sources, methods and assumptions used.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tool provides estimated CO2e emission values for the bearing production
    phase.
  </p>

  <h2>Emissions related to bearing production phase (cradle-to-gate)</h2>
  <p>
    In summary, the PCF values cradle-to-gate are the result of a simplified
    calculation using an aver-age factor based on the total CO2e emissions of
    bearing production in relation to the total weight of produced bearings in a
    reference time period.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <span class="text-primary font-medium">Schaeffler</span> PCF value is
    calculated by multiplying this average factor with the finished weight of
    the selected bearing. Due to its simplified top-down calculation approach,
    it can only provide a first indication of the real PCF of an individual
    bearing, which may deviate on a case-by-case basis substantially from the
    calculated average value. Main reasons for this include but are not limited
    to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the actual steel making process used for the individual bearing</li>
    <li>
      the regional energy mix at suppliersâ€™ sites producing raw materials /
      intermediates
    </li>
    <li>
      the regional energy mix at Schaeffler plants producing the finished
      bearing
    </li>
    <li>
      the heat treatment, machining and final assembly of the individual bearing
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The average factor for rolling bearing production determined for the
    <span class="font-medium text-primary">reference year 2021</span> is set to
    <span class="font-medium text-primary"
      >3.0 kg CO2e per kg of produced bearing weight</span
    >. This includes CO2e emissions from
    <span class="text-primary font-medium">Schaeffler</span> op-erations (GHG
    Protocol, Scope 1), purchased energy (GHG Protocol, Scope 2), and the
    purchased goods used for bearing manufacturing including upstream
    transportation and distribution (GHG Protocol, Scope 3 Upstream).
  </p>

  <p>
    The PCF is mainly driven by the processing of bearing steel as the
    predominant material used for rolling bearings. CO2e emissions of other
    materials used in bearings, such as brass or plastics, are considered to
    have similar values as steel at first approximation.

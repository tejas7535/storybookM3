      <p>
        <span
          >We are pleased about your interest in the Schaeffler Group
          (Schaeffler AG and affiliated companies) and our products. The
          protection of your privacy when using our online offer is very
          important for us. If personal data is processed, we observe the
          applicable data protection laws.

      </p>

      <h2>I. General information about data processing</h2>

      <h3>1. Scope and purpose of processing of personal data</h3>

      <p>
        <span
          >In principle, we collect and use your personal data only insofar as
          it is necessary to provide a functional website as well as our content
          and services offered on the website. Your personal data is regularly
          collected and used only after your consent. An exception to this
          applies in cases where the processing of the data is permitted by
          law.</span
        >
      </p>

      <h3>2. Legal basis for data processing</h3>

      <p>
        <span
          >Processing of your personal data is based on the EU General Data
          Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the German Federal Data Protection
          Act (BDSG).</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span
          >If you have given your consent to the processing of personal data for
          specific purposes, the legal basis for processing of personal data is
          Art. 6 (1)(a)GDPR. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Please
          remember that the withdrawal is only effective for the future.
          Processing based on consent before its withdrawal is not
          affected.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span
          >Processing of personal data in the context of the performance of a
          contract to which you are a party or in order to take steps prior to
          entering a contract at your request is based on Art. 6 (1)(b)GDPR. The
          purposes of data processing are governed by the respective contract
          documents and the subject matter of the contract.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span
          >If processing of personal data is necessary to comply with a legal
          obligation to which we are subject, Art. 6 (1)(c)GDPR serves as a
          legal basis.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span
          >If processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
          interests pursued by Schaeffler or by a third party (e.g. to establish
          or defend legal claims; to ensure IT security; to prevent crimes; to
          conduct business and to further develop services and products) and if
          your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms as data subject do not
          override the aforementioned interest, Art. 6 (1)(f)GDPR serves as the
          legal basis for processing.</span
        >
      </p>

      <h3>
        3. Data erasure and retention period
      </h3>

      <p>
        <span
          >We process and store your personal data for as long as this is
          necessary to satisfy the respective purpose. In addition, such storage
          may take place in order to comply with a legal obligation by Union or
          Member State law, regulation or other provision to which we as
          controller are subject. If the data is no longer necessary or if a
          retention period prescribed by the aforementioned laws has expired,
          your data will be erased on a regular basis.

          who require it as a part of "least privilege" (assignment of user
          rights to the lowest possible extent) and the "need-to-know" principle
          (knowledge of data only if necessary).
        </span>

      <p>
        <span

          have given your consent or if any commissioned processors have agreed
          to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the BDSG.
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span

          countries) will only take place as it is necessary or required by law,

          processor. If service providers in third countries are deployed, in
          addition to written instructions, they are required to comply with
          data protection standards in Europe by agreeing on the EU standard
          contractual clauses.</span

          measures to protect your data that we manage against accidental or
          intentional destruction, manipulation, loss or access by unauthorised
          persons. These safeguards are constantly being developed in accordance

          that is necessary to establish, implement and terminate the contract
          and to satisfy the resulting duties or that Schaeffler must collect
          due to legal provisions. Without these data no contract with

      <h2>Notice on the use of cookies</h2>

      <p>
        When you visit one of the websites of Schaeffler AG and companies in
        which Schaeffler AG, directly or indirectly, holds a majority interest
        (Schaeffler Group), information will be stored on your terminal device
        in the form of a so-called "cookie". Cookies are small text files which
        enable analysis of the use of the website, record settings and data in
        your browser, as well as allow customizing website to your interests and
        displaying interest-based advertising on other websites. We do not
        collect any personal data by means of cookies unless you have expressly
        given us your consent to do so.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Types of cookies</h2>

      <p>
        Depending on their function and purpose, cookies can be divided into two
        categories: technically necessary cookies and optional cookies. There
        may also be so-called first-party cookies, which are cookies that we
        place as the operator of the website, and so-called third-party cookies,
        which are placed by a domain other than ours. In principle, any cookie
        can be removed by deleting the browser cache, thereby immediately losing
        its validity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below you will find a list of all cookies that can be used on our
        websites as well as further information about their purpose, period of
        validity and type.
      </p>

      <h3>Technically necessary cookies</h3>

      <p>
        Technically necessary cookies are required so that you can navigate
        through our websites and operate the basic functions of our websites.
        Without these cookies, the use of the website may be limited.

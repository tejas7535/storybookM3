            <h3>Collecting and Processing Personal Data</h3>
            <p>
              When you visit our websites, our web servers save the name of your
              Internet service provider, the IP address, the website from which
              you are visiting our site, our sites visited by you, as well as
              the date and the duration of the visit. Use of the IP address is
              limited to the extent that is technically necessary; it is
              shortened for statistical purposes and therefore only used
              anonymously. It is not connected to any personal data. We use
              cookies in order to recognize the preferences of visitors so that
              we can improve the content of our websites accordingly. Each
              individual user remains anonymous. Personal details are only saved
              when you enter them voluntarily in the online services provided.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Please note the following information about the use of Google
              Analytics:
            </h3>
            <p>
              This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service
              provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses
              “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help
              the website analyze how users use the site. The information
              generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including
              your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on
              servers in the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
              In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will
              truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member
              States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the
              Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional
              cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google
              servers in the USA. On behalf of the website provider Google will
              use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the
              website, compiling reports on website activity for website
              operators and providing other services relating to website
              activity and internet usage to the website provider.

              Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held
              by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the

# Responsive Breakpoint Documentation

The usage of the Breakpoints is achieved with tailwinds [Responsive Design](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design).

The breakpoint minimum widths and the responsive grid layout is based on the Material Design [Breakpoint system](https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html#breakpoints).
